  summary: "gRPC - A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework"
  description: |
    gRPC is a modern, open source, high-performance remote procedure call
    (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. gRPC enables client and server
    applications to communicate transparently, and simplifies the building
