  summary: gRPC - A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework
  description: |
    gRPC is a modern, open source, high-performance remote procedure call
    (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. gRPC enables client and server
    applications to communicate transparently, and simplifies the building
    of connected systems.

    This package contains the gRPC C++ libraries and header files, as well
    as the code generation plugins.
